# Modeling-Dynamics-Stabilization-of-Rotational-Motion-for-Asymmetric-Spacecraft-in-Mars-Atmosphere
The objective of this project is to develop algorithms to compute geometric and mass-geometric characteristics (moments of inertia, volume, cross-sectional area) of hyperboloid-shaped spacecraft (single-sheet and double-sheet) for stabilizing rotational motion during Mars descent
