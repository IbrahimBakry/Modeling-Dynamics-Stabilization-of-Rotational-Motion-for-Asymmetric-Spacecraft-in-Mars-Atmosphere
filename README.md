# **Modeling Dynamics & Stabilization of Rotational Motion for Asymmetric Spacecraft in Mars' Atmosphere** 🚀🌌  

## **📌 Project Goals:**  
- **Objective:** Develop algorithms to compute geometric and mass-geometric characteristics (moments of inertia, volume, cross-sectional area) of **hyperboloid-shaped spacecraft** (single-sheet and double-sheet) for **stabilizing rotational motion** during Mars descent.  
- **Key Focus:** Solve **nonlinear programming problems** to optimize spacecraft shape for **min/max moments of inertia**, enabling **angular velocity control** **without thrusters** (fuel-free stabilization!). 🔄🚫⛽  
- **Benefit:** Reduce spacecraft mass → **lower mission costs** or **increase payload capacity** for Mars missions! 💰📦

## **🌟 Key Results & Innovations:**  
1. **Single-Sheet Hyperboloid:**  
   - **Moment of Inertia (Iz)** decreases with height (h), while **Ix/Iy** increases. 📉📈  
   - Volume and cross-section shrink as height approaches critical threshold.  
2. **Double-Sheet Hyperboloid:**  
   - Less effective for stabilization → **single-sheet recommended** for Mars missions. 🚫🔵  
3. **Practical Application:** Tested on **Mars Polar Lander** parameters (h = 1.02m, R = 1.2m). Proved feasibility of shape-based stabilization! 🛰️🔴

## **💡 Why This Matters:**  
- **Fuel-Free Stabilization:** Shape adjustment replaces thrusters → **lighter spacecraft**, **more payload**, **cheaper missions**. 🚀💰  
- **Mars Mission Ready:** Validated with real spacecraft data (volume = 1.82 m³, area = 4.52 m²). ✅🔴  
- **Future Potential:** Algorithm adaptable for other asymmetric spacecraft designs. 🌠🔧

## **🔬 Technical Highlights:**  
- **Constraints:**  
  - Volume ≥ **V_min** (for onboard equipment).  
  - Cross-section ≤ **S_max** (thermal shield limits).  
- **Optimization:** Minimized **Iz** while meeting constraints via MATLAB scripts.  
- **Visualization:** Plotted **Iz, Ix, a, c, volume, area vs. height** for analysis. 📉📊
